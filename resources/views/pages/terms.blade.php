            <p>Users must input their personal OpenAI token into the iamsam.ai platform to initiate the AI services. Users are responsible for managing and renewing their OpenAI tokens as needed.</p>

            <p>iamsam.ai will not charge users for the AI-generated messages. The costs incurred for these messages are directly managed and billed through the user’s OpenAI account.</p>
            <p class="mt-0 mb-2 text-decoration-underline">Misuse of OpenAI Token:</p>
            <p>iamsam.ai is not responsible for any misuse or unauthorized use of the user's OpenAI token. Users must safeguard their tokens and are liable for any actions taken with their tokens within the iamsam.ai platform.</p>

            <p class="mt-0 mb-2 text-decoration-underline">Cancellation:</p>

Upon such voluntary termination, the user shall continue to access the platform's services until the culmination of the prevailing monthly billing cycle. It's important to note that, regardless of when a cancellation is effected, no partial refunds for that month's fee will be provided.</p>
